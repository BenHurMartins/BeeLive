Hello there!

That`s the deal, unfortunately the bees are dying!

This is an app that aims to map the hives and bees activity around the globe, so we can study tha climate changes, and 
enviroment around the hive and bees habitats. With the bees and hive locations we will get the necessary data to find out what
is driving the bees to extinction.

We got some time yet!
